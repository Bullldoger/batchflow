1. [Introduction to Research Module](./01_introduction_to_research.ipynb)
    * Basic example
        * 1 pipeline with fixed parameters
            * creating research
            * running several repetitions of an experiment
            * viewing research results
            * saving and loading research
    * Runnung experiments with different parameters aka grid
        * 1 pipeline with variable parameters
            * creating and viewing grids
            * viewing filtered research results
    * More complex execution strategies
        * 2 pipelines, train & test + function + grid
            * adding test pipeline
            * defining pipeline execution frequency
            * adding functions

1. [Advanced topics](./02_advanced_usage_of_research.ipynb)
    * Reducing extra dataset loads
        * 1 pipeline with root and branch + grid
    * Performance
        * execution tasks managing
    * Cross-validation
