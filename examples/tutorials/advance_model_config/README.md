# Advance model configuration

These notebooks focus on some of parameters of model config. These parameters allow you to more flexibly tune the model and achieve better results.

In all notebooks, it is implied that you are familiar with the bathflow basics.
(To refresh the basics, look at [03_ready_to_use_model_tf](../03_ready_to_use_model_tf.ipynb) notebook)
